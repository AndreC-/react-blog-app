# Blog web application

This is a website for users to view, create, edit, and delete blog posts. Users can include text and an image in a blog post.
Users can view other users' blog posts as long as the post is active.

The web application is hosted here: (https://react-blog-app-topaz.vercel.app/)

Feel free to create a new user and add some blog posts!

The front end was developed using the following technologies:

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/)

 The back end was developed with [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) and TypeScript for user authentication and database management.
